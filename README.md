# eBay Product Search - Web

[Jump to screenshots](#screenshots)

* Developed using AngularJS framework.
* Users could search for products on eBay, using eBay's APIs, among others.
* Product's many details could be viewed and they could be added to a wish list.
* Products could also be shared to social media.

Additionally, I later built an [Android application](https://github.com/avikola/ebay-product-search-android), which had similar functionalities, to work alongside this web application.

∴ The web application uses Node.js/Express backend to make API calls and was deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
